            The Enneagram personality test will identify you as one of nine
            different core types, each with its own personally-unique traits,
            fears, and motivations. Finding your Enneagram type may help you
            identify unconscious motivations and patterns and help you gain
            personal insight into relationships, personal growth, and career
            paths.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Additionally, each <b>core type</b> is believed to have two
            neighboring types, one on each side, and these neighboring types are
            known as <b>wings</b>. While an individual has a dominant core type,
            they may exhibit some traits or behaviors of their wing types. Wings
            add additional nuances and variations to an individual's
            personality, providing a broader understanding of their
            characteristics.

            Some Enneagram advocates claim it dates back thousands of years
            through the connection of the "eight deadly sins". The connection
            between the concept of the "eight deadly sins" and the Enneagram
            test is not directly or explicitly stated in the Enneagram system.
            The Enneagram focuses on understanding personality types,
            motivations, and patterns of behavior, while the "eight deadly sins"
            are moral vices within a religious context. However, the more
            commonly known Enneagram system came about in the early 20th
            century.

                Most accreditation goes to Oscar Ichazo. He was a Bolivian-born
                philosopher, spiritual teacher, and founder of the Arica School,
                which integrated elements of psychology, philosophy, and
                spirituality. He is believed to have developed the modern
                Enneagram "personality typing" system. Ichazo identified nine
                personality types, which he believed were based on nine
                fundamental aspects of human consciousness.

                Critics argue that the Enneagram lacks the rigorous testing and
                validation necessary to be considered scientifically sound.
                There is limited peer-reviewed research and much of the
                available literature consists of anecdotal evidence and
                subjective interpretations.

            While some proponents of the Enneagram claim its effectiveness, it
            is important to approach it with a critical mindset and be aware of
            its limitations.

            The Enneagram can provide insights and be a useful tool for personal
            growth and self-reflection, but it should not be considered a
            definitive or scientifically validated measure of personality.

            Taking an Enneagram test and answering honestly is the beginning of
            the exploration of your dominant Enneagram Personality Type.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            For greater accuracy in detailing your personality type, wings, and
            bounds, it is important to answer the questions as accurately as
            possible, based on your behavior and motivations rather than how you
            think you "should" answer or how you "want" to be perceived.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Keep in mind though it may be called a personality "test",
            "assessment", or "quiz", there is no wrong answer as long as you are
            answering honestly about yourself.

              The nine Enneagram core types are divided into three categories

              intelligence or "centers". There are three dominant types within
              each Triad. Each triad is based on a common driving motivation and
              describes where the motives may derive from.

            Our wings are the adjacent personality types that may influence your
            core type. Each core type is believed to have two neighboring types,
            one on each side, and these neighboring types are known as wings.

                While you have a dominant core type, you may exhibit some traits
                or behaviors of your wing types. Wings add additional nuances
                and variations to an individual's personality, providing a
                broader understanding of characteristics and helping identify
                some of the more complex aspects of your personality.

                For example, if your core type is Type 4 and your fall
                (disintegration type) is Type 2, you might recognize that under
                stress, you may exhibit tendencies of seeking validation or
                becoming overly dependent on others. By acknowledging this, you
                can work on maintaining healthy boundaries, practicing

              Although the Enneagram may be able to offer some insights and
              serve as a potent instrument for self-exploration and individual
              development, it should be noted that it does not encompass the

              career assessments of a person's aptitude and aversions. Work

            <div class="career_questions_item answer">
              The Enneagram is an assessment of the human personality. It is
              often used in an attempt to uncover a person's core desires and
              motivations that influence the way information is processed and
              decisions are made. Results show one of the nine core personality
              types.

              Who invented the Enneagram Test?
            </div>
            <div class="career_questions_item answer">
              The earliest association of the Enneagram was from philosopher
              George Gurdjieff, though the contemporary version used today is
              credited to Oscar Ichazo.

            </div>
            <div class="career_questions_item answer">
              Though there are no specific age requirements for the Enneagram,
              many mental health professionals suggest waiting until someone is
              an adult to take the test.

              Can two people with the same Primary Core Type have a different
              wing combination?
            </div>
            <div class="career_questions_item answer">
              The idea of having different wing variations is not universally
              accepted or recognized within the Enneagram community. However,
              some Enneagram practitioners and authors may explore the
              possibility of different wing combinations based on their own
              research, observations, or personal interpretations.
              <br />
              <br />
              In the traditional Enneagram system, Type 9 is typically
              associated with having Type 8 and Type 1 as its wings. However,
              note the Enneagram is a changing and evolving system, and
              different interpretations and variations exist.
              <br />
              <br />
              While the traditional understanding suggests Type 8 and Type 1 as
              the wings for Type 9, some alternative interpretations and schools
              of thought propose that other adjacent types can also serve as
              wings. This can include Type 6 and Type 3 as wings for Type 9.

              While your basic Enneagram type tends to remain the same
